The piece has two original writing sources:

***Fallen flowers*** by *Li Qingzhao*, a female poet born in 1084. And ***The Song of Peach Blossom*** by *Cao Xueqin*, a male novel writer who had been writing about the stories of women during his whole life.

The two works are from two different perspectives of male and female writers. In both of the works, there’s a huge number of Chinese character “花”, which stands for “flower”. Both of the sources focus on the same topic, which is to compared the aging of women to fallen flowers which are no longer attractive.
